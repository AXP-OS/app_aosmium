# this file will be sourced by the ci/cd workflow and allows to overwrite the defaults in the build script

# increase the following counter for just triggering a build with default options:
trigger=1

# overwrite Vanadium version to be used. if unset or empty the latest available will be used
# must be a valid tag (e.g. "132.0.6834.79.1")
#vanadium_version=""

# by default the out/ directory will not be removed. if you want a clean build set this to 1
#clean=1

# sync the sources and apply patches?
# should be set with the above clean var to 1
#gsync=1
